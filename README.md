# QE framework
    
<br/> This repository stores R codes for constructing the quasi-equilibrium (QE) framework, and for testing alternative model assumptions using this QE framework. 

<br/> The quasi-equilibrium framework is developed by Comins and McMurtrie (1993) to analyzing long-term model response to alternative model assumptions. A pool of literature is available on this topic, as summarized in the **Key literatures** section. 

<br/> Here, I am using this framework to evaluate several recently-incorporated model assumptions in determining the time-varying model response to elevated CO2. 

<br/> The baseline model framework is the Generic Decomposition And Yield (GDAY) model, with simplified C-N interactions.


# Repository structure
<br/> The **Run_programs.R** script is the master sheet that calls in all the functions, parameters, scripts to generate results. 
<br/> The **QE_Functions** folder stores all the QE framework related functions. 
<br/> The **QE_Scripts** folder stores all the QE related scripts that perform the analyses. 
<br/> The **QE_Analyses** folder stores all the post-processing functions and scripts for output purposes. 
<br/> The **Parameters** folder stores all the input parameters used in the QE framework. 
<br/> The **Plots** folder stores all the output figures. 
<br/> The **Tables** folder stores all the output tables. 
<br/> The **R_Markdown** folder stores all the R markdown script.
